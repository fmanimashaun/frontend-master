## CSS Grid! Letâ€™s review:
* `grid-template-columns` defines the number and sizes of the columns of the grid
* `grid-template-rows` defines the number and sizes of the rows of the grid
* `grid-template` is a shorthand for defining both grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows in one line
* `row-gap` puts blank space between the rows of the grid
* `column-gap` puts blank space between the columns of the grid
* `gap` is a shorthand for defining both row-gap and column-gap in one line
* `grid-row-start` and `grid-row-end` makes elements span certain rows of the grid
* `grid-column-start` and `grid-column-end` makes elements span certain columns of the grid
* `grid-area` is a shorthand for grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, and grid-column-end, all in one line
* `grid-template-areas` specifies grid named grid areas
* `grid layouts` are two-dimensional: they have a row, or inline, axis and a column, or block, axis.
* `justify-items` specifies how individual elements should spread across the row axis
* `justify-content` specifies how groups of elements should spread across the row axis
* `justify-self` specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the row axis
* `align-items` specifies how individual elements should spread across the column axis
* `align-content` specifies how groups of elements should spread across the column axis
* `align-self` specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the column axis
* `grid-auto-rows` specifies the height of rows added implicitly to the grid
* `grid-auto-columns` specifies the width of columns added implicitly to the grid
* `grid-auto-flow` specifies in which direction implicit elements should be created
