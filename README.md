* `grid layouts` are two-dimensional: they have a row, or inline, axis and a column, or block, axis.
* `justify-items` specifies how individual elements should spread across the row axis
* `justify-content` specifies how groups of elements should spread across the row axis
* `justify-self` specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the row axis
* `align-items` specifies how individual elements should spread across the column axis
* `align-content` specifies how groups of elements should spread across the column axis
* `align-self` specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the column axis
* `grid-auto-rows` specifies the height of rows added implicitly to the grid
* `grid-auto-columns` specifies the width of columns added implicitly to the grid
* `grid-auto-flow` specifies in which direction implicit elements should be created
